The first file provides a general overview of the process and the applications used. The "Setup" file details the steps to set up Replit and the cronjob. This setup remains consistent, regardless of which financial institution's data is being downloaded.
<br><br>
The process is structured in such a way that the Python code accesses an external list. This list contains the data about the websites. How this list has to be built is shown using three different financial institutions. This process can then easily be extended to other institutions from which you want to download the interest rates.
