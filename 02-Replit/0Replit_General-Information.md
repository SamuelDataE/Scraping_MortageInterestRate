The following figure shows how the process looks for the daily download of data via API.

1. The data is provided by the market data provider [Alpha Vantage](../00-Alpha_Vantage).
2. Replit is the IDE which is hosting our python script. With this script the data is pulled out from Alpha Vantage and stored directly in the Replit database.  
3. With the external application [CRONJOB.DE](https://www.cronjob.de/) we are able to execute the python script daily.
4. In this way, the data is collected and cumulated to provide a history of the respective shares.
