# Download of mortgage rates from Swiss financial institutions via webscraping

This repository shows how to download interest rates for mortgages from various Swiss financial institutions using web scraping. The setup is configured so that the data is automatically downloaded daily and stored accordingly.

This endeavor has been achieved using two different methods:

1. [**Webscraper.io**: Web-based platform](01-Webscraper.io)
2. [**Replit**: Integrated development environment (involving coding with Python)](02-Replit)

In terms of complexity, the first case is easier than the second one, since less coding is required. The process of setting up each of these methods is detailed in this repository.

### Enjoy trying it out!
