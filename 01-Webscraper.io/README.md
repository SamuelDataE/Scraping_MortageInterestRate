## General information
In this example, we demonstrate how to download data from the Internet using Webscraper.io. In this use case, we retrieve interest rates for fixed-rate mortgages from various financial institutions. While Webscraper.io requires no programming, we do use some code for data cleaning in Google Sheets.

The first file provides a general overview of the process and the applications used. The "Setup" file details the steps to set up the applications. This setup remains consistent, regardless of which financial institution's data is being downloaded.

The subsequent files demonstrate how to extract data from three distinct financial institutions. These three companies were chosen because each follows a slightly different process. Most data from Swiss financial institutions can be downloaded using one of these approaches.
