### Webscraper.io
<br><br>
It is recommended to use the Google Chrome browsen. This browser has a wide user base, is regularly updated, and tends to be compatible with a variety of web technologies, which makes it a suitable choice for web scraping tools like Webscraper.io. 
<br>
Go no to the website of [Webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) and click on **Install**.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

You have now installed the tool. Now take a look at the [tutorials](https://www.webscraper.io/web-scraper-first-time-install) on how to do the setup in Google Chrome.

When a new base is opened, Airtable creates an Excel-like interface with a table. You can now give your base a name. In this example I have given the name **StockMarketData**. In the first column of the table, the symbols of the respective shares of which you want to build a history can be entered. How to determine the symbols of the respective shares is described under [Alpha-Vantage_Stock Selection](../00-Alpha_Vantage/Alpha-Vantage_Stock-Selection.md).
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

In order to download the data from Alpha Vantage, the add-on application Data Fetcher is required in Airtable. This tool can be added via **extensions**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup2.png "Setup2")

<br><br><br><br>

Search for the tool **Data Fetcher** and add the application.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

Register with the Data Fetcher application. There is a basic version which is free of charge. 
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup4.png "Setup4")

<br><br><br><br>

Start your first request with Data Fetcher.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

1. Name the process
2. Select **Custom**
3. Enter the following Link
   ```
   https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=SYMBOL_SEARCH&keywords=EMMI&apikey=demo
   ```

<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup6.png "Setup6")

<br><br><br><br>

1. Select the table where you have entered your stock symbols. If you didn't change the name manually the table is called **Table 1**.
2. Select the column/field name where you have entered the symbols of your shares. If you didn't change the field manually its called **Name**.
3. Confirm selections.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

Set up the scheduled request. The data should be requested every day in the morning at 0900am. In other words, the table with the data is updated each morning.    
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup8.png "Setup8")

<br><br><br><br>

Each listed stock symbol generates one **run** daily. However, only 100 runs are included in the free basic version. It is therefore very quickly necessary to upgrade. This can be done directly at Data Fetcher under [Pricing](https://datafetcher.com/). The costs for the respective versions are as shown in the figure below. 
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup9.png "Setup9")

1. After setting up the schedule request - click on **run**
2. New Windows opens - click on **continue**
<br><br>

   In this example the following fields have been selected:

3. Click on **Save & run**
<br><br>

<br><br>

We are now back in the original mask of our **base**. The table has now been completed with the new columns accoring to our request. 
1. Delete the columns that we no longer need.
2. Add a new column **Last modified time** 
<br><br>

<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup15.png "Setup15")

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup16.png "Setup16")

<br><br><br><br>

Adjust the column names as they appear in Table 1. Also adjust the format in the respective columns (e.g. word or number).
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

### Zapier
<br><br>
In order to be able to add the data from table 1 to our new table, we need the application Zapier. As soon as the data in the first table is updated, this data is added to the second table. The existing data is not overwritten but added. In this way, we build up a database of the respective shares.

Register yourself at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/login). Enter your personal details.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup17.png "Setup17")

<br><br><br><br>

In the registration process you will be asked for which applications you use Zapier. Select **Airtable**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup18.png "Setup18")

<br><br><br><br>

After the registration is completed you will be able to **create Zap**. Click on the button.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup19.png "Setup19")

<br><br><br><br>

A new page opens with an illustration of the process flow. Click on **1. Untitled Step**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup20.png "Setup20")

<br><br><br><br>

In the new window that opens, select the **Airtable** option.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup21.png "Setup21")

<br><br><br><br>

A new selection bar opens on the right-hand side. Select **New or Updated Record** as the event. **Continue**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup22.png "Setup22")

<br><br><br><br>

You will now be asked to link your Airtable profile to Zapier. Link the accounts and **Grant access**. 
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup23.png "Setup23")

<br><br><br><br>

After connection your accounts click on **contine**. 
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup24.png "Setup24")

<br><br><br><br>

Under the section **Trigger** select the respective options - see figure below. 
In Table 1 in Airtable, the **Last modified time** column is always updated as soon as the data is reloaded. This is the trigger when Zapier is to copy the data into the second table. This process ensures that no data is loaded twice into the second table.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup25.png "Setup25")

<br><br><br><br>

Test the setup. If everything is set correctly, a record should appear. **Continue with selected record**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup26.png "Setup26")

<br><br><br><br>

The representation of the process flow should now look like the following figure. Click on **2. Untitled Step** to setup the second step.
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

In the new window select **Airtable** again.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup28.png "Setup28")

<br><br><br><br>

The selection bar on the right-hand side opens. Select **Create Record** as event and **Continue**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup29.png "Setup29")

<br><br><br><br>

Since you are already linked to your Airtable account there is now second login required. **Continue**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup30.png "Setup30")

<br><br><br><br>

Under the section **Action** select your base and second table where you want to have the database. Allocate the data to the respective fields. In case the naming of your second table in Airtable is incorrect or doesn't make sense - please adjust and refresh. **Continue**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup31.png "Setup31")

<br><br><br><br>

Test the setup. If everything seems okay, click on **Publish**.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup32.png "Setup32")

<br><br><br><br>

The process flow looks now like follow and is complete. To finalise the setup you can name the procedure in Zapier.
<br><br>
![Alt Image Text](./Images/Airtable_Setup33.png "Setup33")

<br><br><br><br>

## Result - final output
<br><br>
Everything is done and from now on the stock exchange data will be loaded daily in your first table and the updated data will be added daily in the second table. The second table, which represents your database, will then look like this over time:
